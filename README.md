👋 Hi, I'm Shaan Kotturu
IT Infrastructure Project Manager | Data & Web Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

  I'm an IT Infrastructure Project Manager with a strong interest in learning new technologies — especially anything related to data, automation, and web development.
  I’m not shifting domains; I’m simply expanding my skill set because I enjoy working with data, creating dashboards, building small automations, and experimenting with web design.
  I believe good project managers should understand technology well enough to guide teams, make informed decisions, and create value. My GitHub represents my learning journey and the things I build along the way.


🌱 My Learning Philosophy

  I learn because I enjoy it.
  I explore because I’m curious.
  And I build because creating something — even small — feels meaningful.
  I’m not rushing to change careers. I’m simply letting my interests guide my growth and seeing where the journey leads.
