# 👋 Hi, I'm Shaan Kotturu  
### *IT Infrastructure Project Manager | Data & Web Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner*

I'm an IT Infrastructure Project Manager with a strong interest in learning new technologies — especially anything related to **data, automation, and web development**.

I'm not shifting domains; I'm simply expanding my skill set because I enjoy:  
- working with data  
- creating dashboards  
- building small automations  
- experimenting with web design  

I believe good project managers should understand technology well enough to guide teams, make informed decisions, and create value.  
My GitHub reflects my **learning journey** and the things I build along the way.

## 🌱 My Learning Philosophy
I learn because I *enjoy* it.  
I explore because I'm *curious*.  
And I build because creating something — even small — feels meaningful.

I'm not rushing to change careers.  
I'm simply letting my interests guide my growth and seeing where the journey leads.
